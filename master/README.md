********************************** BallisticDiffusionModel ***********************************
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Java application that simulates surface deposition using a variety of models.

All classes are authored by Tyler Parsons.
Project initially commited on 7 May 2014.


  +--------------------------+
  | Physics Behind the Model |
  +--------------------------+
    * The model makes uses of bonding as well as diffusion in a surface deposition model.
    * The result is a denser deposition with more predictable behavior than the Ballistic
      Deposition.
      

  +-------------------------+
  
  | Software Implementation |
  +-------------------------+
    * Implemented as a GUI application complete with lattice and graphical visualizations.
    * All models are implemented using an objected-oriented structure and extend an abstract
      Deposition superclass.
    * Classes for statistical analysis, file I/O of simulation data, data wrapping and running
      the application are also included.
